2014/03/01	v1.19.14
- Load of configuration is optimized (foxbin2prg.cfg) to read cfg only once for a massive processing of multiple conversions
- .vbs scripts have been modified to respect the conversion support configuration defined in foxbin2prg.cfg configuration file
- 2 new functions where added to enhance and encapsulate the external use of the evaluation of the conversion support (requires previous call to EvaluarConfiguracion()). Used on .vbs scripts

- foxbin2prg.log file checking dropped, to activate the log file use foxbin2prg.cfg setting Debug=1
- In TX2 header files show the file without path, because genereting it from different places makes unnecesary differences in Diff (Ryan Harris proposal)
- Created a lot of FoxUnit automated tests to check all settings of foxbin2prg.cfg configuration file

2014/02/23	v1.19.12
- Generation of VC2/SC2 with new header metadata <OBJECTDATA> for centralizing uniqueid, timestamp and ZOrder and big reduce of differences in a diff/merge (enhancement proposed by Ryan Harris)

2014/02/09	v1.19.10

- Fixed default NoTimestamps setting
- EXPERIMENTAL: Added new configuration parameter "ClearUniqueID" in foxbin2prg.cfg for Clearing UniqueID in binaries and text versions. Works well and apparently FoxProdoesn't make use of it, but more testing is required

2014/01/24 	v1.19.4
- New "Recompile" parameter for recompiling from PJX directory (if provided)

- VBS Batch scripts: Added progress bar

2014/01/18 	v1.19.3
