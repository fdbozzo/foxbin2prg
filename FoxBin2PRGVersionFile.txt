- Added FoxUnit test cases to bug fix confirmation of both

2014/08/01	v1.19.29
- Bug Fix vcx/scx: Bad Text block detection when the previous line ends with "," (M_N_M)
- Optimizations and refactoring

2014/07/26	v1.19.28
- Feature: Added new options in foxbin2prg.cfg (DBF_Conversion_Included, DBF_Conversion_Excluded) and in filename.dbf.cfg (DBF_Conversion_Order, DBF_Conversion_Condition) for exporting DBFs data to text when DBF_Conversion_Support is 4 (Edyshor)

2014/07/18	v1.19.27
- Feature: Added support for exporting DBF data for DIFF (It's intended just for DIFF small DBFs, as config ones, not for true Data export. Binary fields are not exported and there is not an Import Data feature) (Doug Hennig)

2014/07/06	v1.19.26
- Feature: Drop asterisks between "ENDPROC" and "PROCEDURE", analyzed in that exact order, to regenerate binary without errors. (Daniel Sánchez)
- Feature: Add the l_DropNullCharsFromCode configuration option, enabled by default, to allow droping NULLs from source code. (Matt Slay)
- Bug Fix cfg: ExtraBackupLevel does not work when using multi-configuration

2014/06/25	v1.19.25
- When processing one or multiple files with vbs scripts, show a message indicating the status of the generation, and show the error log if any error occurs (Pedro Gutiérrez M.)
- Code cleaning and normalization
- ClearUniqueID is True by default for tx2 files
- OptimizeByTimestamp is False by default, to avoid possible automatic modifications made by VFP when opening a form or a classlib
- New AllowMultiConfig switch enabled by default, that allow a foxbin2prg.CFG file per directory, overriding main CFG (Mario Peschke)

2014/06/15	v1.19.24
- Bug Fix scx/vcx: The absence of AGAIN keyword on some USE commands throws "tabla in use" error if used the PRG version from VFP command window (Matt Slay)
- Bug Fix scx/vcx: A table field called "text" that begins the line can be confused with the TEXT/ENDTEXT structure and can wrong recognize the rest of the code (Mario Peschke)
- Bug Fix scx/vcx: GetTimeStamp internal method throwse an error when day or month have just 1 digit (happen from v1.19.23)
- New "run_aftercreate_db2" event that permits execution of an external program when using FoxBin2Prg as object (for example, to export table data)

- Added foxbin2prg_de.h file translation of most messages to German (Mario Peschke)

2014/06/07	v1.19.23
- Timestamps and UniqueIds values are back on binaries, and they are just cleaned up on tx2 files if NoTimestamps and ClearUniqueID flags are set. This minimizes some differences on the binary side.
- Added sccdata default value when regenerating PJX binary (which is automatically completed on the PJX when opened anyway)
- Fixed timestamp evaluation for "OptimizeByFilestamp" optimization that evaluates just .??X files, and now .??T (memo) filestamps are evaluated too
- Fixed missing BordeCcolor property on props_optiongroup.txt file

- Added evaluation and generation of properties by classtype, when applicable
- Added support of property evaluation from external file (props_*.txt)
- Added enhanced Unit Tests of bitmap comparisons of screen captures before/after (the original is compared with the regenerated of the regenerated binary, for more accuracy)

- Added Unit Testing of configuration by defaults, by file and by parameters
- Added Unit Testing for checking the generation of classes, forms, reports and menus

- Added optimization based on file timestamps for regenerating only newer binaries and tx2 files (Matt Slay)
- Added English translation in foxbin2prg_en.h for the LOG message of new timestamp optimization
- <DefinedPropArrayMethod> section simplification: Methods and arrays doesn't require preceding * and ^ symbols anymore.

2014/04/17	v1.19.20
- New: CDX filename in DB2 files have relative paths now. This help show less differences when regenerating DB2 files from different paths

2014/03/01	v1.19.14
- Load of configuration is optimized (foxbin2prg.cfg) to read cfg only once for a massive processing of multiple conversions
- .vbs scripts have been modified to respect the conversion support configuration defined in foxbin2prg.cfg configuration file
- 2 new functions where added to enhance and encapsulate the external use of the evaluation of the conversion support (requires previous call to EvaluarConfiguracion()). Used on .vbs scripts
- ExtraBackupLevels Regression: when no defined value, no backup is made

- Bug Fix: Just one level of #IF was contemplated, throwing an error if more levels are nested
- Bug Fix: When regenerating the PJX, default home directory not always was correct
- New FoxUnit automated test added to check bug fix of nested #IF

2014/02/09	v1.19.10
- Added parametrization to enable configuration support for each kind of binary (0=None, 1=Only TX2, 2=TX2 and Binary)
- Fixed default NoTimestamps setting
- EXPERIMENTAL: Added new configuration parameter "ClearUniqueID" in foxbin2prg.cfg for Clearing UniqueID in binaries and text versions. Works well and apparently FoxProdoesn't make use of it, but more testing is required

2014/01/24 	v1.19.4
- New "Recompile" parameter for recompiling from PJX directory (if provided)
